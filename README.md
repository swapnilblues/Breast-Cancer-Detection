# Breast-Cancer-Detection

Detection and recognition of Breast Cancer has been one of the most extreme
challenges being faced in the domain of Cancer detection for a long time. One
of the ways to perform Breast Cancer Detection is by extracting features from
selected images, and devising Classifiers and comparing the results respectively
with a database. The major drawbacks were faced during the steps of Image
Preprocessing and Feature Extraction. In order to perform better Feature
Extraction, we made a modified approach using Local Binary Pattern and
modified Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix, with the aim of extracting better
spatial information and considering the cases to handle the presence of noise.
The main goal of the project is to showcase the comparative study as well as
results, by making use of some well known algorithm and making modifications
to them as per the requirements. Otsuâ€™s Thresholding is used for preprocessing,
followed by our modified approach of feature extraction, and is used to train the
classifiers - SVM and KNN, followed by Genetic Algorithm to enhance results.
We used much known MIAS mammography dataset, consisting of 322 CT-Scan
images classified as benign, malignant and normal, as Input.
